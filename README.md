Usage: 
 1. Calculate H:C for a single length L:

hcratio < L in nm> 

 2. Calculate H:C for a single length L,
moving the center by <shift in nm>: 

hcratio <L in nm> <shift in nm> 

 3. Calculate and save H:C for range of lengths L, moving the center by <shift in nm>:

hcratio <L initial> <L final> <L step> <shift in nm>
