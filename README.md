Usage: 
 1. Calculate H:C for a single length L:

hcratio L_in_nm 

 2. Calculate H:C for a single length L,
moving the center by shift_in_nm: 

hcratio L_in_nm shift_in_nm 

 3. Calculate and save H:C for range of lengths L, 
moving the center by shift_in_nm:

hcratio L_initial L_final L_step shift_in_nm
